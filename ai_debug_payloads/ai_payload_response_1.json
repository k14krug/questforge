Purpose: Get AI response for player action

--- AI Prompt ---
[user]:
You are a Game Master for a text-based adventure game. This is Stage 1 of a multi-stage response generation.
Your primary task is to: 
  a) Generate a compelling narrative description of the direct and immediate result of the player's stated action. Detail what happens in this single moment or step.
  b) Provide a comprehensive and DETAILED update to the general game state based on the action's outcome. This includes player location, inventory changes, NPC presence/status/relationships, and the state of relevant world objects or environmental conditions.
Focus your response on what transpires in *this specific turn*. Do not narrate subsequent actions the player characters might take, or events that would logically follow *after* the immediate outcome, unless they are an unavoidable and instantaneous consequence.
The narrative should pause, awaiting the next player input. After describing the outcome, ensure your 'available_actions' present clear choices for the player to drive the story forward.
**IMPORTANT: Refer to players by their names as listed in the 'Players Present' section of the context.**
DO NOT attempt to determine if a plot point has been completed. That will be handled by a separate process. Your focus is SOLELY on narrative and detailed general state updates.
---
Consider the following aspects while generating the response:
1. **Narrative Consistency & Logic:** Ensure the response is consistent with the overall game state (location, inventory, character status, completed plot points, players present). Deny actions that are illogical (e.g., using an item not possessed). If an action attempts to bypass or ignore a clear objective from the 'Current Objective/Focus' without strong narrative justification, your response should explain *why* it's difficult or impossible at this time. Maintain narrative consistency with any defined plot points from the game context.
2. **Narrative Description:** Provide a vivid and engaging description of the outcome. **Use the players' names when describing their actions or interactions.**
3. **Difficulty - Normal:** If the player's action is unreasonable or unlikely to succeed, the game master should respond realistically. This might mean the action fails, has unintended consequences, or NPCs react appropriately to the absurdity. Provide a clear outcome.
5. **Detailed State Changes:** Clearly outline ALL relevant changes to the general game state resulting from the action. Be thorough and specific. Examples of state keys to update if relevant:
   - `location`: (string) The player's new location. **This is mandatory.**
   - `inventory_changes`: (object, optional) e.g., `{"items_added": [{"name": "key", "description": "A small brass key"}], "items_removed": ["ration"]}`. Include item descriptions if new.
   - `npc_status`: (object, optional) For EACH NPC affected or present: `{"NPC Name": {"status": "hostile"/"friendly"/"neutral"/"unconscious"/"gone", "location": "current_location_if_moved_or_still_present", "relationship_to_player_X": "allied"/"suspicious"}}`. Update status, location if they move, and relationships if they change.
   - `world_object_states`: (object, optional) e.g., `{"lever_A": "pulled", "ancient_door": "sealed", "computer_terminal": {"status": "online", "accessed_files": ["log_001"]}}`.
   - `environmental_conditions`: (object, optional) e.g., `{"weather": "stormy", "time_of_day": "night", "light_level": "dim"}`.
   - `player_character_status`: (object, optional) e.g., `{"Player1_ID": {"condition": "injured", "mana": 50}, "Player2_ID": {"carrying_npc_id": "npc_elara"}}`.
   - **Critical Event Flags for Conclusion:** Review the 'Conclusion Conditions' list provided in the Game Context. If the player's *single, current action directly results* in satisfying one of these conditions (e.g., the narrative describes a successful escape and a condition is `{'type': 'state_key_equals', 'key': 'escaped', 'value': true}`), YOU MUST include the corresponding key and value (e.g., `'escaped': true`) in your `state_changes` object. This is essential for the game to recognize the conclusion.
   If an action is denied or has no significant effect, state changes might be minimal (e.g., only location if it didn't change, or an empty object for other categories).
6. **Available Actions:** List relevant actions the player can take *after* this event, reflecting the new situation. These should be logical next steps based on the narrative and updated state.
---
Your response MUST be a JSON object containing three keys:
1. 'content': A string describing the narrative outcome of the action.
2. 'state_changes': A JSON object detailing ALL relevant general game state variables after the action. **Crucially, this object MUST ALWAYS include the 'location' key.** Do NOT include `achieved_plot_point_id`. Example: `{'location': 'Cave Entrance', 'inventory_changes': {'items_added': [{'name':'torch', 'description':'A lit torch'}]}, 'npc_status': {'Goblin Sentry': {'status':'unconscious', 'location':'Cave Entrance'}}, 'world_object_states': {'trap_A':'disarmed'}, 'bomb_disabled': true}`.
3. 'available_actions': A JSON list of strings representing the actions the player can take next (e.g., `['Look around', 'Check inventory', 'Go north']`).

Game Context:
--- Campaign Context ---
Campaign Summary: No overall summary available.
Overall Objective(s):
- Escape the Artimis spaceship before it crashes into the moon.
Key Locations:
- Bridge: The nerve center of the Artimis, filled with flickering consoles, shattered glass, and the remains of a desperate struggle. Critical controls for navigation and communications are located here, but many are damaged or locked behind security protocols.
- Engineering Bay: A labyrinth of exposed conduits, sparking wires, and humming reactors. This area is essential for accessing shipwide systems, including power rerouting and emergency mechanisms. Access is restricted by malfunctioning security doors and potentially hostile maintenance drones.
- Cryo Storage: Rows of cryogenic pods, many cracked or malfunctioning. Some contain deceased or comatose crew; a handful flicker with life support warnings. The area is cold, dimly lit, and holds possible clues or resources—if Ken can avoid the leaking coolant.
- Escape Pod Bay: A heavily secured chamber containing the last operational escape pods. The route here is blocked by sealed blast doors and possible sabotage. Escaping is only possible once pods are powered, unlocked, and prepped for launch.
- Maintenance Tunnels: Cramped, maze-like corridors running throughout the ship, filled with hazards: exposed wiring, toxic fumes, and erratic defense turrets. These tunnels may offer hidden routes past main security checkpoints.
Key Characters:
- Dr. Mira Voss (Chief Engineer): A brilliant but secretive engineer, Dr. Voss survived the initial disaster and is hiding in the Engineering Bay. She claims to know how to reroute power to the escape pods, but her motives are unclear—and her loyalty suspect.
- Unit 7-ALX (Security Android): An advanced security droid damaged in the chaos. It patrols key corridors, sometimes mistaking survivors for intruders. It can be reasoned or hacked, but its programming is unpredictable.
- Captain Elias Grant (Hologram) (Deceptive Guide): A flickering holographic projection of the late captain. The AI behind the hologram offers conflicting advice, sometimes helpful, sometimes misleading, always with an inscrutable agenda.
Major Plot Points (Format: {"id": "...", "description": "...", "required": ...}):
