## Current Focus Areas

### Primary Objective
Complete Phase 2 AI Integration:
1. Finalize template-AI service connection
2. Implement campaign generation endpoints
3. Build game state management service

### Immediate Tasks
1. Review AI service interface requirements
2. Design campaign generation API
3. Update game state persistence layer

### Key Decisions Needed
1. AI service response format standardization
2. Campaign generation batch size
3. Game state snapshot frequency

### Open Questions
1. Should AI responses be cached?
2. Optimal retry strategy for AI service calls
3. Validation requirements for generated content

### Dependencies
1. AI service availability
2. Database performance benchmarks
3. Frontend mockups for generated content

### Risks
1. AI service latency
2. Content generation consistency
3. State management complexity
