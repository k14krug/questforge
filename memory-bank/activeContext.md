# Active Context - QuestForge - Narrative Guidance System

## Date: 2025-07-05

## 1. Current Work Focus:
Completed the **ID-Based Plot Point System Upgrade** and associated UI/gameplay enhancements for conclusion handling.

## 2. Recent Changes (Completed Task):
The following tasks related to the ID-Based Plot Point System Upgrade and its conclusion handling have been completed:

*   **ID-Based Plot Point System Implementation:**
    *   Modified AI prompts (`prompt_builder.py`) for campaign generation and action responses to use/expect plot point IDs.
    *   Enhanced AI response validation (`ai_service.py`) to check for plot point IDs and uniqueness.
    *   Updated campaign generation (`campaign_service.py`) to auto-complete the first required plot point by ID.
    *   Updated conclusion checking logic (`campaign_service.py`) to verify required plot points by ID and evaluate `conclusion_conditions`.
    *   Updated AI context generation (`context_manager.py`) to include plot point IDs and `conclusion_conditions`.
    *   Updated action handling (`socket_service.py`) to identify the next required plot point by ID, process AI-reported completions by ID, merge AI state changes correctly into `state_data`, track `visited_locations`, and call `check_conclusion` after state updates.
    *   Improved error handling in `campaign_service.py` for AI service errors during campaign generation.
    *   Refined AI prompts (`prompt_builder.py`) to explicitly guide the AI on setting critical event flags based on `conclusion_conditions`.

*   **Verification:**
    *   Thoroughly tested the implementation across different scenarios, confirming reliable game conclusion.
    *   Verified that the AI consistently sets necessary flags (e.g., `escape_successful`) when appropriate.

*   **UI Conclusion Handling:**
    *   Implemented client-side JavaScript logic in `questforge/static/js/socketClient.mjs` to:
        *   Listen for the `game_concluded` SocketIO event.
        *   Update the UI on `play.html` (element with ID `gameStatusDisplay`) to display "Status: Completed".
        *   Disable the action input field (`customActionInput`) and submit button (`submitCustomAction`).
        *   Display the conclusion message from the event payload.
    *   Added `id="gameStatusDisplay"` to the relevant `span` in `questforge/templates/game/play.html`.

*   **Final Turn Presentation:**
    *   Implemented logic in `questforge/services/socket_service.py`'s `handle_player_action` method.
    *   When `check_conclusion` returns `True`:
        *   Appended a system message (`{"type": "system", "content": "** CAMPAIGN COMPLETE! **"}`) to `broadcast_data['log']`.
        *   Set `broadcast_data['actions']` to `["Campaign Complete"]`.
        *   The modified `broadcast_data` is emitted via `game_state_update` for the final turn.
        *   The `game_concluded` event is emitted.
        *   The game's status in the database is updated to 'completed'.

*   **Memory Bank Cleanup:**
    *   The plan file `old-memory-bank-files-dont-use/id_based_plot_point_upgrade_plan.md` was handled (moved by user).

## 3. Next Steps:
*   Update `memory-bank/progress.md` to reflect the completion of the "ID-Based Plot Point System Upgrade" and the "Join Game Screen Shows All Games" task.
*   Await new tasks or further instructions.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations:
*   The "Join Game" screen (`game/list.html`) now displays all games. The ability for a player to *continue* a completed game was noted as a more complex, separate feature and was not implemented in this task.
*   The `STUCK_THRESHOLD` (related to the prior Narrative Guidance System) is set to 3 in `socket_service.py`. This was part of a previous feature but worth noting if further gameplay tuning is needed.
*   The ID-based plot point system stores full plot point objects in `GameState.state_data['completed_plot_points']`.
*   `campaign_service.check_conclusion` now robustly checks required plot points by ID and evaluates `conclusion_conditions` from the campaign against `state_data`.
