# Active Context

## Current Focus: Phase 3 - Test Case Development and Validation

*   **Test Case Development:**
    *   Create new test cases for core components and services.
    *   Validate existing test cases and update as necessary.

## Key References
*   **Application Specification:** [../questforge-spec.md](../questforge-spec.md) - The definitive specification detailing architecture, models, and remaining work phases.
*   **Progress Tracker:** [progress.md](./progress.md) - Detailed breakdown of remaining work phases.
*   **Project Brief:** [projectbrief.md](./projectbrief.md) - High-level overview and core concepts.
*   **Template Model:** [template_model.md](./template_model.md)
*   **Template Creation Process:** [template_creation_process.md](./template_creation_process.md)
*   **Game Creation Process:** [game_creation_process.md](./game_creation_process.md)
*   **Project Intelligence:** [.clinerules](./.clinerules)

## Recent Changes (Completed Task)
*   Created `questforge-spec.md` reflecting current codebase and defining remaining work phases.
*   Updated `projectbrief.md`, `progress.md`, and this file (`activeContext.md`) to align with the new spec.
*   Created `template_creation_process.md`.
*   Reviewed and updated `.clinerules`.
*   Resolved route conflict for `/api/games/create`:
    * Renamed conflicting route in `game_bp` to `/api/games/create-game`.
    * Fixed double-prefix issue in `campaign_api_bp` by removing `url_prefix='/api'` during blueprint registration.
*   Cleaned up excessive debug logging (`print` statements, verbose `logger.debug`) in `questforge/services/campaign_service.py`.
*   Removed unnecessary debug logging related to blueprint registration and route listing during application startup in `questforge/__init__.py`.
*   Corrected game creation issues identified from database analysis:
    *   Fixed `GameState.current_location` population by setting the attribute *after* object creation in `campaign_service.py`.
    *   Correctly associated the game creator using the `GamePlayer` association object in `campaign_api.py`. Verified that the `game_players` table is now being updated correctly.
*   Implemented LLM API connection logic in `ai_service.py`.
*   Enhanced `Template.validate_ai_response`.
*   Implemented error handling and logging in `ai_service.py`.
*   Implemented `campaign_service.update_campaign_state` and `check_conclusion`.
*   Refined join/leave handling in `socket_service.py`.
*   Implemented validation of state changes in `game_state_service.py`.
*   Ensured `get_state` provides necessary data in `game_state_service.py`.
*   **Resolved Game Lobby & Start Issues:**
    *   Fixed infinite `join_game` loop using `hasJoinedRoom` flag in client-side logic.
    *   Resolved persistent `Unexpected token '{'` syntax errors by embedding Socket.IO logic directly in `lobby.html` and using a non-class object structure in `socketClient.mjs` for `play.html`.
    *   Corrected `Missing game_id or user_id` errors by ensuring `window.currentUserId` is set globally in both `lobby.html` and `play.html`.
    *   Ensured correct event handling for `player_status_update` and `game_started` events, allowing UI updates and redirection.
    *   Updated `game_creation_process.md` with detailed Socket.IO implementation notes and lessons learned.

## Next Steps (Phase 2 Tasks)
*   **Gameplay UI (`templates/game/play.html`):**
    *   Develop main game interface (history, status, input) - Completed.
    *   Implement SocketIO JavaScript client logic - Completed.
*   **Template Question Flow Validation:**
    *   Implement backend validation for question flow - Completed.
    *   Provide UI feedback for validation errors - Completed.

## Decisions & Considerations
*   Refine prompt structures in `prompt_builder.py` iteratively based on AI performance.
*   Determine specific strategy for context management (`context_manager.py`).
