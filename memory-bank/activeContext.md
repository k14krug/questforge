# Active Context - QuestForge - Historical Game Summary

## Date: 2025-05-19

## 1. Current Work Focus:
**Conclusion Check Logic Refinement - COMPLETED**
The primary focus was to refine the game's conclusion check logic in `questforge/services/campaign_service.py` to be less restrictive, particularly for string and list comparisons within `state_key_contains` and `location_visited` conditions.

## 2. Key Implementation Steps Completed:
*   **Modified `check_conclusion` in `questforge/services/campaign_service.py`:**
    *   **`state_key_contains` condition:**
        *   If `actual_value` (from `state_data`) is a list, the check now passes if any item in `actual_value` (converted to string) contains the `value_to_contain` (converted to string) as a case-insensitive substring.
        *   If `actual_value` is a string, the check now passes if `actual_value` contains `value_to_contain` as a case-insensitive substring.
    *   **`location_visited` condition:**
        *   The check now passes if the `location_name_condition` (from the conclusion condition) is found as a case-insensitive substring within any of the location strings in `state_data['visited_locations']`.
    *   Updated logging messages to indicate when fuzzy matching is applied.

## 3. Previous Work (Historical Game Summary):
*   **Historical Game Summary Feature Implementation - COMPLETED**
    *   This feature provides the AI with a token-efficient history of game events.
    *   Key files modified: `questforge/models/game_state.py`, `questforge/services/ai_service.py`, `questforge/utils/prompt_builder.py`, `questforge/services/socket_service.py`, `questforge/utils/context_manager.py`, `config.py`.
    *   Addressed an issue where the initial game scene was not summarized by updating `questforge/services/campaign_service.py` (`generate_campaign_structure`).

## 4. Next Steps:
*   Await new task or further instructions.

## 5. Active Decisions & Considerations:
*   The refined conclusion logic allows for more flexible matching, addressing cases like `"Escape Pod Bay"` needing to match `"Escape Pod Bay (outside blast doors)"`.
*   The changes specifically target substring matching for strings and list elements, improving robustness for common use cases.
*   The `state_key_equals` condition remains a strict equality check, which is appropriate for scenarios requiring exact matches.
*   The historical summary feature is complete and aims to improve long-term narrative consistency.
