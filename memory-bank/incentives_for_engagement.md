# Incentives for Engagement in QuestForge

## Objective
To implement a system of incentives that encourages players to engage with the narrative and follow plot points in the QuestForge application.

## Proposed Strategies

1. **Reward Systems:**
   - Implement a points or currency system that rewards players for completing plot points. This could include:
     - Experience points that contribute to character progression.
     - In-game currency that can be used to purchase items or upgrades.
     - Unique items or abilities unlocked through engagement with the narrative.

2. **Narrative Rewards:**
   - Introduce story elements that are only accessible if players engage with specific plot points. This could include:
     - Special character interactions or revelations that enhance the story.
     - Unlockable side quests that provide additional context or depth to the main narrative.

3. **Dynamic Challenges:**
   - Create challenges that are influenced by the completion of plot points. For example:
     - If players have completed certain plot points, they may face fewer obstacles or receive hints that make subsequent challenges easier.
     - Conversely, if they skip plot points, they may encounter more difficult scenarios or enemies.

4. **Feedback Mechanisms:**
   - Provide players with feedback on how their actions impact the story. This could involve:
     - In-game notifications that inform players of the consequences of their choices.
     - Visual or auditory cues that reinforce the importance of engaging with the plot.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Design Reward Structures:**
   - Define the types of rewards that will be offered and how they will be distributed based on player actions.

2. **Integrate with Game State:**
   - Modify the `GameState` model to track player rewards and progress related to plot points.

3. **Develop Narrative Elements:**
   - Create narrative content that ties into the reward system, ensuring that players feel motivated to engage with the story.

4. **Test and Iterate:**
   - Implement the incentive system and gather player feedback to refine the approach, ensuring it enhances the gameplay experience without making it feel forced.

## Next Steps
Once this plan is approved, I will proceed to implement the changes in the codebase and update the memory bank accordingly.
