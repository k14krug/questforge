# Phase 5: Enhanced Game Creation (Completed)

This phase focused on giving the game creator more control over the campaign generation process by allowing them to add specific customizations and override template details before the AI generates the campaign.

**Status:** Implemented and integrated into the workflow as of 2025-04-05.

## Implemented Features

1.  **Creator Customizations:**
    *   **UI:** The game creation form (`questforge/templates/game/create.html`) includes a dedicated section ("4. Add Customizations") with textareas for:
        *   Key NPCs
        *   Important Locations
        *   Specific Plot Hooks
        *   Special Rules or Mechanics
        *   Things to Exclude
    *   **Data Storage:**
        *   A `creator_customizations` JSON field was added to the `Game` model (`questforge/models/game.py`).
        *   The game creation API (`/api/games/create` in `questforge/views/game.py`) saves the non-empty customization inputs into this field when the `Game` record is created.
    *   **Backend Logic:**
        *   The SocketIO `handle_start_game` event (`questforge/services/socket_service.py`) retrieves the saved `creator_customizations` from the `Game` object when triggering campaign generation.
        *   The `generate_campaign_structure` function (`questforge/services/campaign_service.py`) receives these customizations.
        *   The `generate_campaign` function (`questforge/services/ai_service.py`) receives these customizations.
    *   **Prompt Integration:** The `build_campaign_prompt` function (`questforge/utils/prompt_builder.py`) incorporates the `creator_customizations` into a dedicated section of the prompt and instructs the AI to use them when generating locations, characters, plot points, rules, and exclusions.

2.  **Template Detail Overrides:**
    *   **UI:** The game creation form (`questforge/templates/game/create.html`) includes a section ("3. Customize Template Details") that dynamically loads fields corresponding to the selected template's attributes (e.g., Genre, Core Conflict, World Description, Default Rules). These fields are pre-filled with the template's data, allowing the creator to override them.
    *   **Data Handling:**
        *   The frontend JavaScript collects non-empty overrides into a `template_overrides` object.
        *   This object is sent to the game creation API (`/api/games/create`).
        *   *Note: These overrides are NOT persisted in the `Game` model.*
    *   **Backend Logic:**
        *   The `generate_campaign` function (`questforge/services/ai_service.py`) receives the `template_overrides` dictionary.
    *   **Prompt Integration:** The `build_campaign_prompt` function (`questforge/utils/prompt_builder.py`) checks for overrides for each template field and uses the overridden value if present; otherwise, it uses the original template value.

## Summary

The enhanced game creation features allow creators to significantly tailor the AI-generated campaign beyond the base template by providing specific instructions, inclusions, and exclusions, as well as overriding core template details. This functionality is integrated into the standard game creation flow.
