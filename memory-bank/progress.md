# Project Progress

## Reference Specification
*   **Main Spec:** [../questforge-spec.md](../questforge-spec.md) - Details the current architecture, models, and remaining work phases.

## Completed Features & Documentation

*   **Core Framework:** Flask app factory, DB models (User, Template, Game, Campaign, GameState), Migrations, Auth basics, Blueprints, Config.
*   **Template System:** Template model, CRUD UI & backend logic.
*   **Game Creation Foundation:** Game/Campaign/GameState models, creation wizard UI, backend logic for template selection/initial record creation, basic AI interaction points in Template model.
*   **Real-time Foundation:** SocketIO initialized, basic service structure.
*   **Memory Bank & Spec:** All core Memory Bank docs updated, new `template_creation_process.md` added, `questforge-spec.md` created/updated.

## Remaining Work (Phased Approach from Spec)

**Phase 1: Core AI & Campaign Generation (High Priority - Current Focus)**

*   All tasks completed.

**Phase 2: Core Gameplay Loop (High Priority - Next Focus)**

*   **Socket Service Enhancements (`socket_service.py`):**
    *   Implement `handle_action` event (processing, AI call) - Completed.
    *   Trigger game state updates - Completed.
    *   Implement broadcasting of updates - Completed.
    *   Refine join/leave handling - Completed.
*   **Game State Service (`game_state_service.py`):**
    *   Ensure `update_state` is robust - Completed.
    *   Ensure `get_state` provides necessary data - Completed.
*   **Gameplay UI (`templates/game/play.html`):**
    *   Develop main game interface (history, status, input) - Completed.
    *   Implement SocketIO JavaScript client logic (including lobby ready/start functionality) - Completed.
*   **Template Question Flow Validation:**
    *   Implement backend validation for question flow - Completed.
    *   Provide UI feedback for validation errors - Completed.

**Phase 3: Validation & UI Polish (Medium Priority)**

*   Implement Template Question Flow Validation (backend & UI feedback).
*   Polish Template Management UI (consider JSON editor).
*   Improve general UI/UX (feedback, consistency).

**Phase 4: Testing & Deployment Prep (Medium Priority - Ongoing)**

*   Write unit & integration tests for new components (utils, services, AI mocks).
*   Write tests for SocketIO handlers & gameplay.
*   Increase overall test coverage.
*   Verify/test production configuration (Gunicorn, Systemd, Nginx).

## Known Issues & Potential Enhancements (Post-MVP)

*   AI response validation needs further enhancement (content quality).
*   Template editing could benefit from version history.
*   General UI/UX improvements.
*   See `questforge-spec.md` for more potential enhancements.

## Documentation Status
*   `questforge-spec.md` is the primary specification.
*   Memory Bank documents (`projectbrief.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, process docs, `.clinerules`) are aligned with the spec.
