# Project Brief: QuestForge

## Overview

QuestForge is a Flask-based web application designed for hosting AI-powered, multiplayer text-based adventure games. It allows users to create, join, and play games where an AI acts as the game master, managing the narrative and responding to player actions in real-time. The system is intended for deployment on a home network (e.g., Raspberry Pi). The current development focus is on implementing the core AI integration and gameplay loop to reach a functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

## Core Concepts

1.  **Templates:** Reusable blueprints defining game structure, rules, setup questions, and AI interaction points. See [Template Model Documentation](./template_model.md).
2.  **Template Creation:** Users can create new templates through the application interface. See [Template Creation Process](./template_creation_process.md).
3.  **Game Creation:** Games are instantiated from templates, customized via a question flow, and have their initial campaign structure generated by an AI service. See [Template-to-Game Creation Process](./game_creation_process.md).
4.  **AI Game Master:** An external AI service generates campaign details based on templates/user input and responds to player actions during gameplay.
5.  **Real-time Gameplay:** WebSocket (SocketIO) is used for real-time communication between players and the game state.
6.  **Persistence:** Game state, campaign structure, user data, and templates are stored in a MySQL/MariaDB database.

## Architecture Highlights

*   **Backend:** Python Flask using the application factory pattern.
*   **Database:** SQLAlchemy ORM with Flask-Migrate for migrations.
*   **Real-time:** Flask-SocketIO.
*   **Frontend:** Jinja2 templates, basic CSS/JavaScript.
*   **Modularity:** Flask Blueprints for organizing views (Auth, Game, Template, Campaign API).
