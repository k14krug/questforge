# QuestForge Project Brief

## Project Vision
Create an AI-assisted tabletop RPG campaign creation and management system that:
1. Generates coherent game content from templates
2. Maintains persistent game state
3. Provides real-time collaboration tools
4. Supports multiple game systems

## Current Implementation Status
- Core infrastructure complete (see progress.md)
- AI integration in progress (see activeContext.md)
- Real-time features planned for next phase

## Key Architectural Decisions
1. Flask backend with SQLAlchemy ORM
2. Modular AI service integration
3. Event-driven state management
4. RESTful API design

## Technical Stack
- Backend: Python/Flask
- Database: MySQL/MariaDB
- AI: Service-oriented architecture

## Roadmap
1. Complete AI integration (current focus)
2. Implement real-time features
3. Build UI components
4. Finalize deployment pipeline

## Divergences from Original Spec
1. Authentication implemented earlier
2. Database schema remains unchanged
3. Additional test coverage added
4. More modular AI service design

See progress.md for detailed implementation status and activeContext.md for current focus areas.
