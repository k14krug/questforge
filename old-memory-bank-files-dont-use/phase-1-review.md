# Phase 1 Implementation Review (QuestForge Spec)

This document summarizes the review of Phase 1 tasks ("Core AI & Campaign Generation") as defined in `questforge-spec.md`, comparing the specification against the actual codebase implementation as of 2025-04-04.

## 1. AI Service Implementation (`ai_service.py`)

*   **Status:** Largely Complete.
*   **Findings:**
    *   LLM integration using `openai` library is correctly implemented.
    *   Configuration via environment variables is functional.
    *   `generate_campaign` function implemented: Uses `prompt_builder`, requests JSON, parses, basic validation.
    *   `get_response` function implemented: Uses `context_manager` & `prompt_builder`, requests JSON, parses, basic validation.
    *   Error handling (JSON, API calls) and logging are implemented.
*   **Notes/Divergences:**
    *   A `TODO` comment exists regarding implementing more robust validation, potentially using `Template.validate_ai_response`.

## 2. Campaign Service Implementation (`campaign_service.py`)

*   **Status:** Largely Complete.
*   **Findings:**
    *   `create_campaign` function implemented: Orchestrates `ai_service.generate_campaign`, saves `Campaign` and `GameState`, handles transactions.
    *   `update_campaign_state` function implemented: Calls `ai_service.get_response`, applies state changes.
    *   `check_conclusion` function implemented: Basic placeholder logic exists.
*   **Notes/Divergences:**
    *   **Resolved:** `create_campaign` now correctly uses the `Template.validate_ai_response` method.
    *   **Model Divergence:** The service populates a `template_id` field on the `Campaign` object, which is not documented in the `Campaign` model definition within `questforge-spec.md`.

## 3. Prompt Engineering (`prompt_builder.py`)

*   **Status:** Complete (Initial Implementation).
*   **Findings:**
    *   File exists at `questforge/utils/prompt_builder.py`.
    *   `build_campaign_prompt` implemented: Constructs detailed prompt for campaign generation as specified.
    *   `build_response_prompt` implemented: Constructs prompt for AI response based on context and action as specified.
*   **Notes/Divergences:**
    *   Marked for ongoing refinement as per the spec update.

## 4. Context Management (`context_manager.py`)

*   **Status:** Partially Complete.
*   **Findings:**
    *   File exists at `questforge/utils/context_manager.py`.
    *   `build_context` function implemented: Gathers data from `GameState` and `Campaign` and formats it. Includes placeholder for `recent_events`.
*   **Notes/Divergences:**
    *   **Major Divergence:** Spec-mentioned functions `compress_history` and `prioritize_content` for managing context length are **not implemented**.

## 5. AI Response Validation (`Template.validate_ai_response`)

*   **Status:** Implemented.
*   **Findings:**
    *   The `Template.validate_ai_response` method has been implemented in `questforge/models/template.py` to correctly validate the structure required for campaign generation.
    *   The `campaign_service.create_campaign` function now correctly calls `template.validate_ai_response` to validate the AI response.
*   **Notes/Divergences:**
    *   None related to the implementation and usage of this specific validation method.

## 6. Game Creation Flow Integration (`game.py`, `campaign_api.py`)

*   **Status:** Complete.
*   **Findings:**
    *   The `/api/games/create` route in `campaign_api.py` correctly handles the integration.
    *   Receives data, validates input (including some Phase 3 validation against `question_flow`).
    *   Creates `Game` and `GamePlayer` objects.
    *   Calls `campaign_service.create_campaign` correctly.
    *   Handles errors and manages database transactions appropriately.
    *   Returns correct response/redirect URL.
*   **Notes/Divergences:** None for this specific task.

## Overall Phase 1 Summary

Phase 1 is largely implemented, providing the core functionality for AI-driven campaign generation and the initial setup for gameplay responses. The primary remaining divergence is the missing context management functions (`compress_history`, `prioritize_content`). The minor divergence regarding AI response validation invocation has been resolved.
